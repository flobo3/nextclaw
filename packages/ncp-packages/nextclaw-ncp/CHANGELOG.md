## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Release the unpublished multi-agent batch as one aligned npm release.

  This release includes the new multi-agent management flow across CLI, server, and UI, agent-scoped session ownership and child-session conversation unification, plus the agent identity rendering improvements for spawned child sessions and tool cards.

  It also ships the openclaw marketplace/runtime npm install alignment and republishes the dependent public package chain so workspace versions stay consistent downstream.

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- Publish the remaining unpublished workspace drift from March 31 and April 1 as one aligned patch batch, including the native file preview pipeline updates, structured terminal tool result rendering, and the recent tool card UX refinements.

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- f65c1f5: Republish Nextclaw UI with upstream frontend dependency chain.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Publish the remaining unpublished drift from today's commits as one unified patch batch.

  This batch includes the chat skill token rendering and recent-skill ordering updates, the enter-to-send guard while a chat run is active, and the tightened tool argument validation across the NCP/runtime bridge. It also republishes the dependent public package chain so workspace dependency versions stay aligned for downstream installs.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 9a336f2: Publish the remaining public-package drift from today's commits as one unified patch batch, including the channel enable/disable fixes, declarative channel form layout, subagent follow-up/runtime fixes, and the landing asset updates that landed after the last tagged release.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Publish the NCP subagent live follow-up fixes, including spawn tool result updates, parent-agent realtime continuation, and the aligned frontend chat visibility changes.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish Nextclaw UI with upstream frontend dependency chain.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify the NCP file pipeline around an asset store abstraction with `put`, `export`, and `stat`.

  This release removes default prompt-time file content injection, replaces `attachmentUri` with `assetUri`, adds `asset_put` / `asset_export` / `asset_stat`, and updates the UI/server upload flow to return and render managed assets directly.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Ship the full set of current unreleased workspace package changes in one release batch, including the server/CLI updates already sitting in the working tree and the previously committed public package drift that has not been published yet. Republish the NCP agent runtime export surface so NextClaw can resolve `LocalAttachmentStore` after update, and add a release guard that blocks shipping public workspace dependents when a package has drifted past its published tag without a pending changeset.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Republish all public workspace packages with pnpm publish guards so released manifests no longer retain workspace:\* dependencies and future npm publish misuse is blocked before release.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish the NCP-linked package set so published consumers resolve the
  latest NCP protocol/runtime exports used by the current NextClaw CLI build.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify the latest NCP native chat chain, runtime capability assembly, chat UI alignment, stream/reasoning/tool fixes, and marketplace metadata publishing into a single minor release.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Refactor the NCP agent backend stack from run-centric semantics to session-centric live execution.
  - Replace run-based stream and abort payloads with `sessionId`-based live session APIs.
  - Rename the manifest capability from `supportsRunStream` to `supportsLiveSessionStream`.
  - Remove run-store/controller abstractions from `@nextclaw/ncp-toolkit` and move active execution ownership into the live session registry.
  - Align the HTTP client/server transports and React hooks with live session streaming.
  - Update `ncp-demo` to use the session-centric backend, add a `sleep` tool, and remove mock LLM mode.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Expose the new NCP agent runtime/backend type exports and session delete API, and add the docs entry under Settings in the main chat sidebar.

## 0.1.0

- Bootstrap package skeleton with NCP protocol types and endpoint base abstractions.
