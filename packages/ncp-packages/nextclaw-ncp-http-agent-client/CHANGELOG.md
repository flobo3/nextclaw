## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- Publish the remaining unpublished drift from today's commits as one unified patch batch.

  This batch includes the chat skill token rendering and recent-skill ordering updates, the enter-to-send guard while a chat run is active, and the tightened tool argument validation across the NCP/runtime bridge. It also republishes the dependent public package chain so workspace dependency versions stay aligned for downstream installs.
